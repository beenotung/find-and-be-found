# Find and be Found

最近在構想一個尋人的平台，用類似燈神 (akinator) 的問答形式，透過不同問題來縮細 pool 入面嘅人，嚟 match 其他用戶出來。可以應用在職場獵頭人、找合伙人、找服務提供者、找手作小店、找交友約會對象等場境。

這次在介紹 web app 開發教學的時候就直接把這個構思實現出來。由如何開始一個 node.js project，到畫面開發，到數據庫設計和創建，到後台邏輯開發。一邊做一邊講解釋，帶新手投入應用編程開發。

I've been thinking about creating a people-finding platform that uses a question-and-answer approach similar to Akinator. The system would narrow down the pool of candidates through a series of questions and show the profiles of the matched users for further contact. This platform could be applied in various scenarios, such as recruiting, job hunting, finding a co-founder, service provider, or new friends and dating mates.

In this video, I'll be sharing my thoughts on how to develop a web app that turns this idea into reality. We'll start from scratch, discussing how to set up a Node.js project, design and develop the user interface, create a database, and develop the backend logic. I'll explain everything step-by-step, so beginners can easily follow along and learn how to develop a web app from scratch.
